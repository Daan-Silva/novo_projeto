# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
# include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

linter:
  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized here.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in this section,
  # it can also be suppressed for a single line of code or a specific Dart file
  # by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint`
  # syntax on the line or in the file producing the lint.
  rules:
  # Uncomment and modify the rules as needed.
  # avoid_print: false
  # prefer_single_quotes: true
